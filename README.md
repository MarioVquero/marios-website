#My Personal Website

Created a small free site holding some of my projects as I can't currently host anything nicer 

However the more advanced portfolio is still being worked on and I will record a Demo in order to show it off properly

[Site](https://github.com/RandomMexican/PortfolioSite)

Developed using React + Vite with Tailwind CSS for the styling and the frontend
